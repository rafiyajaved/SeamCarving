# SeamCarving
Python Implementation of the Seam Carving Algorithm for Content-Aware Resizing

Seam Carving was introduced in a seminal paper at SigGraph 2007 https://faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/index.html

The main finding of the paper was, in summary, that by first mapping the pixels of a image to the amount of information they contain, we can cleverly expand and contract images in a way that minimally distorts the actual image.

This is my python implementation of the algorithm based on the paper.
